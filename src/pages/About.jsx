        Hello! I am a multi-disciplinary designer with a background in media, communication and culture. I enjoy bringing research to life visually and am experienced in crafting and enhancing content for various audiences and platforms; turning complex information into engaging and accessible stories and explaining technical issues to non-technical people. 
</p><p>
In my journey so far, Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of working with some amazing people: academics and policymakers in the UK; grassroots-based feminists and community radio broadcasters in the global south; teenagers learning how to write for the web; deaf students needing training in Photoshop; musicians, DJs, and artists all eager to share their valuable insights. 
</p><p>
I like learning new things and exploring new places. I am happiest when working in that sweet spot where technology, art and storytelling come together.            </p>
