In my journey so far, Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of working with some amazing people: academics and policymakers in the UK; grassroots-based feminists and community radio broadcasters in the global south; teenagers learning how to write for the web; deaf students needing training in Photoshop; musicians, DJs, and artists all eager to share their valuable insights.

I like learning new things and exploring new places. I am happiest when working in that sweet spot where technology, art and storytelling come together.            </p>
